## 🎯 Project Goal

To streamline machine learning workflows using a **user-guided, modular architecture** that:  
- Loads and optionally stores data in a relational database (MySQL)  
- Provides comprehensive data understanding and visualization  
- Implements a flexible preprocessing pipeline with encoding and scaling options  
- Supports flexible target labeling strategies  
- Trains and evaluates multiple ML models (supervised learning)  
- Saves trained models for production deployment  

---

## 🛠️ Features

✅ Load data from CSV/Excel and optionally from MySQL  
✅ Save/load data to/from MySQL using SQLAlchemy & PyMySQL  
✅ Data understanding: shape, data types, missing values, and summary statistics  
✅ Preprocessing: missing value imputation, encoding, scaling (Standard/MinMax)  
✅ Visualization: histograms, correlation heatmaps, boxplots, scatterplots  
✅ Flexible target labeling: label encoding and one-hot encoding with reconstruction  
✅ Train supervised ML models (classification & regression) with evaluation metrics  
✅ Save trained models as pickle files using a class-based saver

## 💻 How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ML_Workflow.git
cd ML_Workflow
````

2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Includes: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `sqlalchemy`, `pymysql`, `lightgbm`, etc.

3. **Launch the Jupyter Interface**

```bash
jupyter notebook ML_Workflow_Interface.ipynb
```

4. **Follow the Guided Steps in the Notebook**

* Load and optionally store your dataset
* Perform exploratory data analysis and visualization
* Preprocess and label your data
* Select and train your ML model (auto-detect or manual)
* Save the trained model for deployment

## 📊 Supported ML Models

### Supervised Learning

* **Classification:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, LightGBM
* **Regression:** Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVR

### (Note: Unsupervised learning will be added in future versions)

---

## 📦 Outputs

* Cleaned and preprocessed DataFrame ready for modeling
* Trained ML model with printed evaluation metrics
* `.pkl` file containing the serialized trained model for deployment

---

## 🔐 Database Integration

* Supports **MySQL** with secure credential input
* Uses `SQLAlchemy` and `pymysql` for robust DB interaction
* Supports data storage with column renaming and type management

---

## 🧪 Example Usage Snippet

```python
# In the notebook interface:

# Load data
df = load_data()

# Optionally store in DB
store_data_in_database(df, "mydb", "mytable", "root", "password", "localhost", "3306")

# Preprocess data with standard scaling
preprocessed_df = preprocess_pipeline(df, scale_method='standard')

# Label target variable
labeled_df = Labeler().label_data(preprocessed_df, target_column='Severity')

# Train model pipeline with auto-detection
model = run_model_pipeline(labeled_df, target_column='Severity')

# Save trained model
saver = ModelSaver(filename="my_model.pkl")
saver.save(model)
```
