## 🎯 Project Goal

To streamline machine learning workflows using a **user-guided, modular architecture** that:
- Loads and optionally stores data in a relational DB
- Offers detailed data understanding
- Preprocesses and visualizes data
- Labels the target variable
- Trains multiple ML models (both supervised & unsupervised)
- Saves trained models for production

---

## 🛠️ Features

✅ Load data from CSV/Excel  
✅ Option to store/load data from MySQL  
✅ Column renaming before DB storage  
✅ Full data understanding (shape, types, nulls, stats)  
✅ All-in-one preprocessing: missing values, encoding, scaling  
✅ Visualizations: correlation, histograms, boxplots, scatterplots  
✅ Label dependent variable  
✅ Train models (classification, regression, clustering)  
✅ Evaluate with accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score  
✅ Save trained models via `pickle`

## 💻 How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ML_Workflow.git
cd ML_Workflow
````

2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Dependencies include: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `sqlalchemy`, `pymysql`, etc.

3. **Run the Interface Notebook**

Launch the Jupyter interface:

```bash
jupyter notebook ML_Workflow_Interface.ipynb
```

4. **Follow Steps in Notebook**

Each cell guides you through:

* Loading and optionally storing your dataset
* Performing analysis, preprocessing, labeling
* Choosing and training your ML model
* Saving the final model for deployment

## 📊 Supported ML Models

### Supervised

* **Classification**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes
* **Regression**: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVR

### Unsupervised

* **Clustering**: KMeans, DBSCAN, Agglomerative

---

## 📦 Output

* Cleaned and ready-to-train DataFrame
* Trained model with evaluation metrics
* `.pkl` file containing the serialized model

---

## 🔐 Database Integration

* Currently supports **MySQL**
* Credentials are securely prompted
* Data stored using `SQLAlchemy` and `pymysql`

---

## 🧪 Example

```python
# In the notebook:
df = load_data()
store_data_in_database(df, "mydb", "mytable", "root", "password", "localhost", "3306")
```
